This assignment is the first part of a multi part project to write an optimizing compiler for Minijava. We start with the LL(k) grammar for minijava and follow simplification and optimization phases, similar to what is seen in a standard optimizing compiler. In this assignment, we will implement a type checker for the minijava compiler.
